= Bootstrap with CDI

In https://jakarta.ee/specifications/restful-ws/3.1/[Jakarta RESTful Web Services 3.1] the `SeBootstrap` API was
introduced. This quickstart shows how to use the API with RESTEasy.

== Building

To build the `bootstrap-cdi` quickstart you must have https://maven.apache.org/[Maven] installed and at least Java 11.
Then you simply need to run the following:

----
mvn clean verify
----

This will create a `bootstrap-cdi.jar` which can be executed from the command line. A test is also executed as part of
the build.

== Running the Quickstart

The `bootstrap-cdi.jar` created can be executed from the command.

----
java -jar target/bootstrap-cdi.jar
----

This will start an Undertow container with RESTEasy and CDI support. To exit the application you need to send a `SIGKILL`
, for example `CTRL+C`.
